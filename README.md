## Weka for Matlab

The purpose of this library is to create a lightweight, easy-to-use wrapper of the Weka machine learning library to use inside of Matlab. This should facilitate fast testing and deployment of machine learning routines with Matlab.

The code is currently experimental and buggy, but will be updated with documentation and examples soon.
